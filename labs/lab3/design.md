### Reflection

* What programming concepts and techniques were completely new to you? 
  * _Drawing visuals on screen using rectangles is still the only completely new concept for me._
* Were there roadblocks or issues you needed to spend more time or seek help with? How did you overcome those?
  * _One issue I had was that the ship image appeared huge on screen and I couldn't figure out how to make it smaller.
    What I ended up doing was putting it in an image resizer and literally shrinking the image size that way._
* What aspect are you interested in learning more about or becoming more proficient with?
  * _I would like to create more projects where we segment the code into different files like this. I feel like I need
  a better understanding of referencing class methods from another file._
* Conclude your reflection with thoughts about the overall experience: 
* How long did it take? Did you do it all at once, or you spaced it out?
  * _It took me about an hour to complete, so I did it all in one sitting again._
* Think of one lesson learned about yourself as a learner and/or computing professional:
  * _Something I noticed is that while I was following the instructions, I was always thinking of "How could I do this
  better? Realistically, it was pretty hard to imagine that since most of the code is referencing the pygame package
  which I have no experience using personally._
