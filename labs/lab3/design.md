### Reflection

* What programming concepts and techniques were completely new to you? 
  * _None at this point._
* Were there roadblocks or issues you needed to spend more time or seek help with? How did you overcome those?
  * _The only issue I had this time was finding the alien image, which I couldn't. So I just used a random one from GitHub._
* What aspect are you interested in learning more about or becoming more proficient with?
  * _I feel like I would like to learn more about the actual pygame module because its kind of a blackbox to me._
* Conclude your reflection with thoughts about the overall experience: 
* How long did it take? Did you do it all at once, or you spaced it out?
  * _It only took an hour, did it in one sitting as usual._
* Think of one lesson learned about yourself as a learner and/or computing professional:
  * _I'm starting to find out that I really dislike following exact coding directions like this. It's kind of mind
  numbing in a way haha._
