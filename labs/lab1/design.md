### Reflection

* What programming concepts and techniques were completely new to you? 
  * _I would say the only new concept for me was surfaces. I have never used surfaces in python before, 
  the closest thing I've done to that was in vb_
* Were there roadblocks or issues you needed to spend more time or seek help with? How did you overcome those?
  * _Since they pretty much gave use everything, I didn't have any real issues._
* What aspect are you interested in learning more about or becoming more proficient with?
  * _I hope we do more with surfaces, because I find programming more engaging with a visual like that. 
  Plaintext computation gets stale after a while lol._
* Conclude your reflection with thoughts about the overall experience: 
* How long did it take? Did you do it all at once, or you spaced it out?
  * _It really only took me 30 minutes to complete this one, I did it one sitting._
* Think of one lesson learned about yourself as a learner and/or computing professional:
  * _I kind of already knew this, but I find myself less engaged when the answer (code in this case) 
  is given to me right away_
