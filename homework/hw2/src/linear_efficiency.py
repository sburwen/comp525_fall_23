Implementation requirement:
- Apply the accumulation pattern
- Do not modify the values of the parameters
- Do not return a parameter
- If the use of a built-in data type method eliminates the use of the
    accumulation pattern in the design of a function, do not use it.
    Instead, write a 2nd design for that function to illustrate the use of
    built-in data type method.

    Creates a new string with characters in `sentence` such that:
        - all subsequence occurrences of a character in `sentence` are
        replaced  with '*' in the returned sentence.
    :param sentence: string
    :return: string with the first occurrences of each character in `sentence`
