"""
Create a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative
 integer using recursion. The function should take an integer as input and 
 return its factorial. For example, factorial(5) should return 120.

- Use appropriate function docstrings. 
- Include the time complexity of your function in your docstring.
- No need for design documents, unit tests, etc. Just the function and a call
to the function.
