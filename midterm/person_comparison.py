"""
Create a Python class Person with attributes for a person's name and age. 
Implement a method to compare the ages of two people, returning a message that 
indicates who is older. For example, if person1 is 30 years old and person2 is 
25 years old, calling person1.compare_age(person2) should return 
"person1 is older."

- Use appropriate function docstrings. 
- Include the time complexity of your function in your docstring.
- No need for design documents, unit tests, etc. Just the function and a call
to the function.
