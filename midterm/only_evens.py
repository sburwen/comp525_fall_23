"""
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a 
new list with only the even numbers. For example, if the input is 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the function should return [2, 4, 6].

- Use appropriate function docstrings. 
- Include the time complexity of your function in your docstring.
- No need for design documents, unit tests, etc. Just the function and a call
to the function.
