"""
Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and sorts them based on 
the length of the strings, with the shortest strings coming first. 
For example, if the input is ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"], the 
function should return ["date", "apple", "cherry", "banana"].

- Use appropriate function docstrings. 
- Include the time complexity of your function in your docstring.
- No need for design documents, unit tests, etc. Just the function and a call
to the function.
